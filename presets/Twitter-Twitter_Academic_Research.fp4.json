  "description": "* You need at least Facepager Version 4.3.5 for this preset *\n\nThis Preset is an example how you can use the Twitter API v2 for academic research. \nThis specialized track on the new Twitter API grants free access to full-archive search and other v2 endpoints, a higher Tweet volume cap, as well as enhanced features and functionality to get more precise, complete, and unbiased data for analyzing the public conversation. To use this product track, you need to submit your use case through the Academic Research application.\nTo get more information see https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research \n\nTo apply for an academic research account see https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/academic/is-it-right-for-you \n\nAfter you applied for the account you get an Client ID and a Client secret. In the Generic module, enter them into the settings (next to the login button). After that you can log in and get an access token.\n\nFor the  specific endpoint used in the preset see the documentation at https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/api-reference/get-tweets-search-recent\n\nThe preset searches tweets - add any search term as seed node. \n\nUp to 100 tweets are returned in one request, see the max_results  parameter. For Academic Research projects, this can be increased to 500. In order to get multiple pages of results, increase the Maximum pages option.\n\nThe results contain a node for every tweet as well for the included media and users. The type of node can be found in the Object Key column. Adjust the \"Key to extract\" option and the expansions  parameter if you want to omit includes media and users.",
